Diamond Dynasties Trade Analyzer - Season Maintenance Guide
When to Update
After the draft (to capture all drafted players)
After major FA periods (weekly waivers, etc.)
After trades (so values reflect new rosters)
Weekly (recommended) or whenever you want fresh stats
Step 1: Update Rosters & Standings
Open a terminal/command prompt
Navigate to your project folder:

cd C:\Users\Alex\DiamondDynastiesTradeAnalyzer
Run the data exporter:

python data_exporter.py
A browser will open - log into Fantrax if prompted
Wait for it to finish (exports rosters, standings, matchups, transactions)
Step 2: Add Actual Stats (Optional - Once Season Starts)
Go to Fantrax → Players → Stats
Filter to Hitters, then click Export (CSV)
Save as hitter_stats.csv in the project folder
Filter to Pitchers, then click Export (CSV)
Save as pitcher_stats.csv in the project folder
Run the data exporter again:

python data_exporter.py
It will automatically pick up the stats CSVs
Step 3: Push to GitHub
Stage and commit the updated data:

git add league_data.json
git commit -m "Update league data"
git push
Render will auto-redeploy (takes ~1-2 minutes)
